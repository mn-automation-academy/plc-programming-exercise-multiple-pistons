# Multiple Piston Exercise for CoDeSys

This repository contains a free exercise designed to help you take your first steps in using Function Blocks and modular design in CoDeSys.
This example is based on the single piston exercise found here: https://github.com/mn-automation-academy/plc-programming-exercise-piston

**What you will learn:**

* Basic concepts of code re-use
* Implementing Function Block in CoDeSys.
* Simulating a real-world system (multiple pistons moving generic products).

**Prerequisites:**

* **CoDeSys V3.5 SP19 Patch 5 (3.5.19.50) or later installed.** This exercise has been tested with this specific version.
* **Basic familiarity with the CoDeSys IDE.**

**How to Run:**

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project file (likely a `.project`) in CoDeSys.
3.  **Enable Simulation Mode:** In CoDeSys, go to the "Online" menu and select "Simulation". Ensure the simulation mode is active.
4.  Run the simulation. You should now be able to interact with the simulated train level crossing based on the logic implemented in the project.

**Getting Started:**

The project includes comments and a basic structure to guide you through the implementation of the piston logic using function blocks.
